<h1>Welcome Visitor 👋
<br/><br/>I'm blessed to find you here 💞️</h1>

This is <b>@moath-sandouka</b>, a Frontend Developer, 👀 and this is my fun and interactive workspace 👀, 

I'm interested in tinkering 🛠 around with UI/UX designs, it's really a fun way to learn and progress 🤖

I’ve been working as a front-end web developer 🖥 at different companies, and I'm always seeking new challanges.

I believe my experience and skills in 
  - <b>JavaScript and ECMAScript 6</b>, 
  - <b>HTML</b>, 
  - <b>SASS, Grid CSS and raw CSS</b>, 
  - <b>libraries such as React</b> for building user interfaces, 
  - <b>version control such as Git</b>, 
  - <b>cross-browser and device testing</b>, 
  - and <b>WPO "Web performance optimization"</b> would make me <b>fit</b> in any relevant role. 

I’ve worked in large development teams 🪙 and in startups 🪙 as well that have sharpened my technical skills, improved my communication, and made me understand what it takes to meet tight deadlines.

I’ve recently developed multiple React Projects 🗒 for different clients. As a designer and a frontend developer engaging with different clients, this has given me the opportunity to manage a diverse range of client requests. I have also proven myself as a team player, which is another crucial requirement for any relevent role.

My keen developed interest in programming and design helps me find creative and innovative solutions to a wide variety of technical challenges and develop visually appealing websites.

If you have reached to this very line, I'd like to thank you for your time and I hope you'd have fun digging my profile
